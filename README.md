This is a simple program for entering a password and checking its strength.

# How to use
...

# Limitations
This software is strictly for educational purposes only. It is not a secure way of storing a password due to it's simplicity. It also shouldn't be used to decrypt more sophisticated encyptions, this is morally wrong as it can potentially hurt the livelyhood for someone else. Not only that, you don't learn from quick and easy
jobs. 

# Licences
License chosen is Apache 2.0, highly permissive while offering patent protection. This patent was chosen to allow for patent protection while allowing for free 
use of the software. This is a very simple program to check the strength of a password and shows the encryption process, it may seem like leaving it out in the open 
is a bad idea, there are far more sophisticated ways therefore this should be treated as a learning experience. As the story goes for Macus Hutchins from the article, "The Confession of Marcus Hutchins", he would have never made as far as he did without showing his work to the few people he were in contact with during his 
time coding for criminals. Even though his past haunted him for a while, it was that experience that give him the knowledge to being able to prevent a tragedy. 
His background was based on the people around him, things he picked up during his youth, and put that to code. Coding was all in the experience to him, 
therefore coding should be a collaborative effort.
