is a bad idea, there are far more sophisticated ways therefore this should be treated as a learning experience. As the story goes for Macus Hutchins from the article, "The Confession of Marcus Hutchins", he would have never made as far as he did without showing his work to the few people he were in contact with during his 
time coding for criminals. Even though his past haunted him for a while, it was that experience that give him the knowledge to being able to prevent a tragedy. 
His background was based on the people around him, things he picked up during his youth, and put then to code. Coding was all in the experience to him, 
therefore coding should be a collaborative effort.
